Bupa Challenge
==============

### Prerequisites

In order to run this page you need either host it somewhere and access `index.html` via http or run a server locally. If you have Node.js installed, I'd recommend [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) tiny http server, which is really easy to install and use.

Everything is precompiled, you don't need `npm`, `bower` or `grunt` in order to run it.

### Third party libraries

There are several third party libraries used in this app:
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Pikaday](https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday/)
- [Moment](http://momentjs.com/)
- [Swiper](http://www.idangero.us/swiper/)
